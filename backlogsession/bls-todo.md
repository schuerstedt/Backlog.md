# BLS System Improvement TODO

This file tracks suggested improvements for the `bls` command-line tool itself, gathered during retro sessions.

- **DONE  `--latest` flag for `bls task list`**: Implement a `--latest` flag that allows reading tasks from the most recent session without creating a new one. This would prevent accidental session creation when trying to review past work.
