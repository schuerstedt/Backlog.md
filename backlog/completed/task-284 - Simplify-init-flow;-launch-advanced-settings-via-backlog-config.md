## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Goal: Make backlog init minimal and move advanced settings to run under backlog config when opted in.

Summary
- Keep agent instruction selection in init.
- After that, ask a single confirm: "Configure advanced settings now? (y/N)".
- If Yes: immediately run `backlog config` (interactive wizard) and then finish init.
- If No (default): finish init with safe defaults; no other prompts.
- Preserve all existing flags and non-interactive behavior for backward compatibility.

Context
Init currently prompts for many settings (branch checks, remote, zero-padding, editor, web UI, etc.). We want a faster first-run and make advanced choices accessible via a dedicated interactive flow at `backlog config` (no subcommand).
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [x] #1 Init prompts only: project name ➜ agent instruction selection ➜ advanced confirm (default No).
- [x] #2 If user selects Yes, launch `backlog config` interactive wizard immediately and return to complete init.
- [x] #3 Implement default action for `backlog config` (no args) to run an advanced interactive wizard; keep `config list|get|set` working unchanged.
- [x] #4 Remove other prompts from init (zero-padding, editor, cross-branch, web UI, git hooks) unless advanced=Yes path is taken (then handled in wizard).
- [x] #5 Honor all existing init flags and `--defaults` to remain non-interactive and not auto-launch the wizard.
- [x] #6 Re-init: prefill project name with existing; rerun agent selection; advanced confirm behaves the same; wizard preloads current config values.
- [x] #7 Post-init summary shows project name and which agent instruction files were created/skipped; no advanced details unless wizard ran.
- [x] #8 backlog config wizard includes: cross-branch (checkActiveBranches, remoteOperations, activeBranchDays), git behavior (bypassGitHooks, autoCommit), ID formatting (zeroPaddedIds width/disabled), editor (defaultEditor with availability check), web UI (defaultPort, autoOpenBrowser).
- [x] #9 Defaults when wizard is skipped: checkActiveBranches=true, remoteOperations=true, activeBranchDays=30, bypassGitHooks=false, zeroPaddedIds disabled, defaultEditor unset, defaultPort=6420, autoOpenBrowser=true.
- [x] #10 Docs: Update README init section and mention `backlog config` for advanced options; update any references in AGENTS.md if needed.
- [x] #11 Tests: add/adjust tests for new init flow ordering, advanced confirm default=No, and `backlog config` default action; keep existing tests passing (agent files, flags, non-interactive).
- [x] #12 Backwards compatibility: existing scripts/CI using init flags or `--defaults` continue to work without wizard launch or extra prompts.
- [x] #13 Code style/quality: Biome passes; type-check passes; no regressions in TUI flows; final summary output remains concise.

## Implementation Plan

<!-- SECTION:PLAN:BEGIN -->
1. Extract the existing advanced init prompts into a reusable helper and wire it as the default `backlog config` wizard.
2. Rework `backlog init` interactive flow to only ask for project name, agent instructions, and the advanced-settings confirm that launches the wizard when accepted.
3. Update docs and automated tests to match the new flow, ensuring defaults and flag-based behaviors remain unchanged.
<!-- SECTION:PLAN:END -->

## Implementation Notes

<!-- SECTION:NOTES:BEGIN -->
- Extended init integration prompt with ESC handling, highlight fallback, MCP client automation, and summary outputs for MCP/CLI/no AI paths.
- Adjusted non-interactive defaults to prefer MCP, enforced invalid flag combinations, and updated template/README links.
- Tests now cover MCP default, CLI agent selections, and skip behavior under new flow.
